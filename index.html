				<h2>Personal hobbies</h2>

			<p>
				Billiards and badminton are the sports I love very much. They can not only help me exercise, but also
				improve my physical coordination ability. The competition with my friends in these sports is always full
				of joy and challenges, which also makes me cherish and deepen my friendship more. In my spare time, I
				like to read all kinds of books, among which my favorite author is Sanmao. Her works can always bring me
				spiritual pleasure and different life experiences.

				<h2>Academic performance</h2>

			<p>
				In terms of academic study, I majored in communication engineering and studied English hard. Once, I won
				the third prize on the soeasy platform and won the college scholarship because I reached the required
				IELTS score. I have always maintained a thirst for knowledge, and developed a modest and diligent
				attitude towards learning. In terms of finishing my homework, I always try my best and never copy or
				cheat.

				I think I have many advantages. First, I am good at organizing friends to complete a series of tasks,
				and I am able to give unique insights. In addition, I have mastered and used Word, Excel and other
				office software, and taught myself Photoshop software, which can complete some picture processing work.
				In terms of personality, I am optimistic and cheerful, and I am good at dealing with interpersonal

				For the future, I am full of expectations and vision. I want to stay true and have enough time to invest
				to what I like. I hope my future studies can be smooth and I can find a job I like in the future. Only
				in this way can I fully devote my energy and time and gain satisfaction and sense of accomplishment from
				my work. This is not only reflected in material, but also in spiritual and personal growth.
